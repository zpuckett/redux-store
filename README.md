- SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Usage
- This e-commerce website has products sorted by categories.
- Users can add, update quantity and delete items in cart.
- To purchase items in cart, users must sign up and login.
- Payments are handled by Stripe.
- Once user paid, it will redirect them to the success page.
